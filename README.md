# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Extract the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock in the dataset provided by the client.  Create a VBA macro to provide the information based on year with a simply button click in the excel sheet. Output the information in a formatted table in order to better visualize the stocks with the highest and lowest yearly return.  Additional request to refactor the code to make sure it is scalable for much larger data sets of stocks.      

### Purpose
To refactor the initial code generated to analysis the total daily volume and yearly return of the stocks provided in the data set to be scalable for much larger data sets.  Demonstrate reduced runtime with the factored code.  

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### 2018 Stock Analysis

 
## Summary
- Advantages of refactoring code

- Disadvantages of refactoring code 
 
- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
